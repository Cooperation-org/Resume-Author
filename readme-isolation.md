# TextEditor Isolation Issue Analysis

## Problem Description
Multiple TextEditor instances on the same page are experiencing content cross-contamination. Text from one section (e.g., Work Experience) is appearing in other sections (e.g., Professional Summary).

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Global Quill Registration
The TextEditor component performs global Quill modifications that affect ALL editor instances:
- Custom `BadgeBlot` registration
- Custom `PlainClipboard` module registration
- Global icon modifications

### 2. Shared State Issues
- Multiple TextEditor instances share the same Quill class-level registrations
- No proper isolation between editor instances
- Potential clipboard content retention across instances

### 3. Badge System Interference
The custom badge blot system for verified credentials may be triggering content duplication when:
- Users add credentials to text
- Badge blots are inserted
- Content is copied/pasted between sections

## Technical Details

### Current Implementation Problems:
```javascript
// These are registered globally and affect ALL editors:
Quill.register(BadgeBlot)
Quill.register('modules/clipboard', PlainClipboard, true)
```

### Symptoms:
1. Content from Work Experience appears in Professional Summary
2. Badge insertions may duplicate content across sections
3. Clipboard operations may leak between editors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Unique Editor Instances
- Each TextEditor now has a unique ID
- Prevents reference confusion between instances

### 2. Instance-Specific Clipboard
- Clipboard module is now bound to specific editor instance
- Prevents clipboard content leakage

### 3. Proper Cleanup
- Added cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks
- Ensures proper component lifecycle management

### 4. Controlled Updates
- Better handling of value prop changes
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders and state updates

## Changes Made

1. **Added unique ID generation** for each TextEditor instance
2. **Modified clipboard handler** to be instance-specific
3. **Added proper cleanup** on component unmount
4. **Improved value synchronization** between prop and editor state
5. **Made badge registration conditional** (only once per app lifecycle)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test multiple sections with different content
2. Verify copy/paste works correctly within each editor
3. Confirm credential badges work without affecting other sections
4. Check that content saves properly for each section
5. Ensure no content bleeds between sections

## Future Improvements

1. Consider using Quill's container option for better isolation
2. Implement a more robust state management for multiple editors
3. Add debugging tools to track editor instances
4. Consider lazy loading Quill for better performance
